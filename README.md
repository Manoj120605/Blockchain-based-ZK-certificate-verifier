### Key Features ‚ú®

* [cite_start]**ZK-Proof Verification**: The core of the system verifies the authenticity and ownership of digital certificates using zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring privacy and security[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**Blockchain Integration**: Certificates are anchored to a blockchain (specifically, the Ethereum testnet) to ensure immutability and prevent tampering[cite: 6]. [cite_start]The application uses `web3j` for interacting with the blockchain[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Selective Disclosure**: Users can generate selective disclosure proofs to reveal only specific fields of their certificate (e.g., degree level) without exposing other personal data[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**RESTful API**: The application exposes a REST API for certificate verification, batch verification, and metadata retrieval[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Web Interface**: A modern, responsive web interface is included for easy interaction with the verification service[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Security**: The system incorporates `Spring Security` for authentication and access control[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**Database**: It uses an in-memory `H2` database for development and demonstration purposes, with `Spring Data JPA` for data persistence[cite: 6, 11].
